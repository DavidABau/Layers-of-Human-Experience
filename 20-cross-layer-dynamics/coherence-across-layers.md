# Coherence Across Layers

Coherence across layers refers to the capacity to maintain orientation, responsibility, and proportional action while navigating multiple domains of human experience. It is not achieved by privileging any single layer, but by preserving differentiation while allowing appropriate interaction.

This form of coherence is functional rather than affective. It is expressed in action, judgment, and consequence, not in internal state alone.

## Differentiation as a Requirement

Coherence depends on the ability to distinguish layers even when they are active simultaneously.

When differentiation is lost:
- emotions become explanations
- explanations become justifications
- symbols become authorities
- meaning becomes exemption
- consensus becomes morality

Preserving coherence requires recognising what kind of contribution each layer can legitimately make, and where its authority ends.

## Integration Without Collapse

Coherence does not require isolating layers or suppressing experience. It requires integration without collapse.

This means:
- emotional experience is acknowledged without granting epistemic authority
- cognitive models are used without mistaking them for reality
- social norms are considered without surrendering responsibility
- moral judgment is exercised without certainty or purity
- existential meaning is carried without becoming directive
- symbolic experience is integrated without being literalised

Integration preserves complexity rather than resolving it prematurely.

## Coherence Under Load

Under stress, uncertainty, or conflict, coherence is most likely to fail. Narrowing of attention, dominance of a single layer, or collapse across layers becomes more likely.

In such conditions, coherence does not require optimal functioning. It requires:
- resisting absolutisation of the dominant layer
- remaining responsive to consequence
- tolerating ambiguity without forcing resolution
- preserving responsibility even when clarity is partial

Coherence under load is often quieter and less confident than incoherence.

## Coherence Is Not a State

Coherence is not:
- emotional calm
- internal harmony
- alignment of belief
- consistency of narrative
- symbolic insight or transcendence

It is not something that can be maintained independently of context.

Coherence is the ongoing work of orientation in the presence of constraint.

---

## Practical Implications

Across layers, coherence is reflected in:
- proportional response rather than intensity
- revision rather than defence
- responsibility rather than reassurance
- restraint rather than certainty
- action that remains accountable to outcome

These qualities are observable over time rather than felt in the moment.

## Orientation Rather Than Completion

Coherence across layers is not a stable achievement. It fluctuates with load, context, and capacity.

This framework does not promise coherence. It provides a way to recognise when coherence is being lost, and what kind of correction may be required without collapse, blame, or idealisation.

That recognition alone preserves alignment with reality.
