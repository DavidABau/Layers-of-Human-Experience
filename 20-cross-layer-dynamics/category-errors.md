# Category Errors

A category error occurs when the language, authority, or expectations of one layer of experience are incorrectly applied to another. Many forms of confusion, conflict, and harm arise not from bad intentions, but from unrecognised category errors.

This repository exists primarily to make such errors visible.

## What a Category Error Is

A category error is not simply a mistake or misunderstanding. It is a structural misalignment in which a domain of experience is asked to do work it cannot do.

Examples include:
- treating emotions as evidence of truth
- treating symbolic experience as explanation
- treating social consensus as moral justification
- treating moral conviction as certainty
- treating insight as exemption from consequence

Each of these errors arises from importing authority from one layer into another without constraint.

## Why Category Errors Are Persuasive

Category errors persist because each layer:
- feels subjectively compelling when active
- offers partial truth within its own domain
- provides relief from uncertainty or responsibility

When under stress, individuals and groups often default to the layer that feels most immediate, meaningful, or reassuring — and then allow it to dominate interpretation.

This produces confidence without coherence.

## Common Cross-Layer Confusions

Some frequent patterns include:

- **Affective → Cognitive**  
  Emotional intensity treated as factual proof.

- **Symbolic → Moral**  
  Transcendent experience used to justify action or exemption.

- **Social → Ethical**  
  Group norms treated as moral authority.

- **Cognitive → Existential**  
  Explanations mistaken for meaning.

- **Existential → Relational**  
  Personal meaning narratives imposed on others.

Each pattern involves a valid layer exceeding its domain.

## Consequences of Unchecked Category Errors

When category errors are not recognised, they can lead to:
- spiritual bypass
- emotional absolutism
- ideological rigidity
- moral certainty without accountability
- erosion of trust between people operating in different layers

Importantly, these failures often feel *coherent* from within the dominant layer, even as they produce incoherence in practice.

## Category Errors and Coherence

Coherence does not require suppressing any layer of experience. It requires recognising which layer is active, what it can legitimately claim, and where its authority ends.

A coherent orientation preserves:
- emotional validity without granting epistemic authority
- symbolic meaning without explanatory power
- moral seriousness without certainty
- social coordination without abdication of responsibility

Recognising category errors is not an intellectual exercise. It is a practical skill necessary for navigating complexity without collapse.

## Orientation, Not Correction

This repository does not exist to eliminate category errors entirely. Some degree of cross-layer bleed is inevitable in human life.

Its purpose is to provide a map that allows such moments to be recognised, corrected, or held with greater care — especially when stakes are high.

Clarity here reduces harm without demanding perfection.
