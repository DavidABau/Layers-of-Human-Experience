# Metaphysical Inflation

Metaphysical inflation occurs when interpretations, experiences, or models are extended beyond their legitimate domain and treated as claims about ultimate reality, causality, or authority.

What begins as metaphor, symbol, or provisional explanation becomes literal, total, or unquestionable.

## What Metaphysical Inflation Is

Metaphysical inflation is not curiosity about reality or engagement with philosophical questions. It is the overextension of meaning into ontology.

Common forms include:
- treating symbolic experience as literal truth
- treating explanatory models as exhaustive accounts of reality
- treating insight as revelation
- treating abstraction as authority
- treating provisional maps as final descriptions

In each case, scope is exceeded without acknowledgment.

## Why Metaphysical Inflation Is Appealing

Metaphysical inflation persists because it:
- provides a sense of ultimate explanation
- resolves uncertainty prematurely
- offers identity and status through insight
- reduces complexity into a unified narrative
- shields beliefs from falsification or revision

Inflation often feels like understanding, clarity, or awakening.

## Costs of Metaphysical Inflation

When metaphysical inflation is sustained, it can lead to:
- detachment from practical constraint
- erosion of epistemic humility
- justification of action without accountability
- dismissal of disagreement as ignorance or resistance
- confusion between meaning and mechanism

Inflated metaphysics often collapse under real-world consequence.

## Metaphysical Inflation and Coherence

Coherence requires that metaphysical questions remain proportionate to evidence, experience, and consequence.

Metaphysical inflation undermines coherence by:
- dissolving constraint into abstraction
- granting authority without responsibility
- substituting explanation for engagement
- obscuring limits of knowledge and perspective

Orientation is preserved by keeping metaphysics provisional and bounded.

## Containment Rather Than Denial

This framework does not reject metaphysical inquiry or symbolic meaning.

It distinguishes between:
- metaphysics as exploration
- metaphysics as explanation
- metaphysics as authority

Containment preserves inquiry without permitting inflation.
