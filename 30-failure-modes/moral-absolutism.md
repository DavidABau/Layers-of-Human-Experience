# Moral Absolutism

Moral absolutism occurs when moral judgment is treated as certain, total, or self-justifying, such that ambiguity, context, trade-off, and consequence are dismissed or denied.

Rather than guiding action under constraint, morality is treated as an unquestionable position.

## What Moral Absolutism Is

Moral absolutism is not moral seriousness or ethical commitment. It is the conversion of moral concern into certainty.

Common forms include:
- treating moral conviction as moral truth
- denying trade-offs or moral remainder
- equating disagreement with immorality
- treating intent as sufficient justification
- invoking principles without regard for consequence

In each case, judgment is replaced by certainty.

## Why Moral Absolutism Is Appealing

Moral absolutism persists because it:
- reduces complexity and doubt
- offers identity and belonging
- provides clear boundaries of right and wrong
- relieves the burden of ongoing judgment
- justifies action without revisability

Certainty feels stabilising when responsibility is heavy.

## Costs of Moral Absolutism

When moral absolutism is sustained, it can lead to:
- punitive or disproportionate responses
- moral signalling replacing ethical reasoning
- erosion of trust and dialogue
- justification of harm in the name of principle
- resistance to correction or accountability

What is protected is certainty, not morality.

## Moral Absolutism and Coherence

Coherence requires moral engagement without moral finality.

Moral absolutism undermines coherence by:
- eliminating proportional response
- denying uncertainty and moral remainder
- collapsing ethics into identity or ideology
- substituting rules or principles for judgment

Ethical responsibility persists even when certainty does not.

## Orientation Rather Than Relativism

This framework does not advocate moral relativism or indifference.

It distinguishes between:
- moral seriousness (taking responsibility seriously)
- moral absolutism (refusing uncertainty or revision)

Recognising this distinction preserves ethics without collapsing into certainty.
