# Emotional Absolutism

Emotional absolutism occurs when emotional states are treated as authoritative determinants of truth, morality, or appropriate action.

Rather than being recognised as signals, emotions are granted explanatory or normative power beyond their domain.

## What Emotional Absolutism Is

Emotional absolutism is not emotional awareness or emotional honesty. It is the elevation of feeling to final authority.

Common forms include:
- treating intensity as importance
- treating sincerity as correctness
- treating emotional harm as moral harm by definition
- treating discomfort as injustice
- treating regulation as resolution

In each case, emotion substitutes for judgment.

## Why Emotional Absolutism Is Appealing

Emotional absolutism persists because it:
- feels immediate and authentic
- requires no mediation or interpretation
- offers moral clarity without ambiguity
- protects against uncertainty or doubt
- discourages challenge or disagreement

When emotions are absolutised, questioning feels like invalidation.

## Costs of Emotional Absolutism

When emotional absolutism is sustained, it can lead to:
- reactivity framed as authenticity
- erosion of shared standards of truth
- moral claims insulated from critique
- disproportionate responses to complex situations
- difficulty resolving conflict or disagreement

Emotional certainty often escalates rather than resolves harm.

## Emotional Absolutism and Coherence

Coherence requires acknowledging emotions as data without granting them authority they cannot carry.

Emotional absolutism undermines coherence by:
- collapsing affective and ethical layers
- bypassing consequence and proportionality
- treating internal states as external claims
- discouraging reflection or revision

Emotions inform orientation; they do not complete it.

## Orientation Rather Than Suppression

This framework does not advocate emotional suppression, control, or dismissal.

It distinguishes between:
- emotional validity (feelings are real)
- emotional authority (feelings decide)

Recognising this distinction preserves emotional life without sacrificing coherence.
