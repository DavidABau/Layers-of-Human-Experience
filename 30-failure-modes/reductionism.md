# Reductionism

Reductionism occurs when a single layer of human experience is treated as sufficient to explain, justify, or resolve phenomena that properly belong to multiple layers.

In reductionist frameworks, complexity is simplified by collapsing diverse domains into one explanatory register.

## What Reductionism Is

Reductionism is not careful analysis or legitimate simplification. It is a structural error in which one layer is granted explanatory authority beyond its domain.

Common forms include:
- reducing meaning, ethics, or identity to biology
- reducing responsibility to emotion or intention
- reducing truth to social consensus
- reducing complexity to a single theory or model

Each form replaces orientation with certainty.

## Why Reductionism Is Appealing

Reductionism persists because it:
- simplifies decision-making
- reduces ambiguity
- offers predictive or explanatory power
- creates a sense of mastery or control

In conditions of uncertainty, reductionist explanations can feel stabilising even as they distort reality.

## Costs of Reductionism

When reductionism is sustained, it can lead to:
- misdiagnosis of problems
- inappropriate interventions
- erosion of responsibility
- dismissal of valid experience from other layers
- brittle systems that fail under stress

What is gained in simplicity is lost in adequacy.

## Reductionism and Coherence

Coherence requires recognising that different layers contribute different kinds of information and authority.

Reductionism undermines coherence by:
- collapsing distinctions
- overextending explanations
- replacing judgment with mechanism
- treating partial truth as sufficient truth

Restoring coherence involves reintroducing the excluded layers, not rejecting analysis.

## Orientation Rather Than Rejection

This framework does not reject scientific, psychological, or social explanation. It situates them.

Reduction is a tool. Reductionism is a misuse of that tool.
