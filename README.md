# Layers of Human Experience

This repository provides a descriptive map of distinct layers of human experience that are often confused, collapsed, or treated as interchangeable.

It is not a theory of reality, a spiritual framework, a developmental ladder, or a system of personal improvement. It exists to help readers recognise *what kind of experience they are having*, what that layer can and cannot do, and where common category errors arise.

The goal is orientation, not instruction.

## What This Repository Is For

- Distinguishing different domains of human experience without privileging any single one
- Preventing category errors (e.g. treating emotional states as truth, or symbolic experiences as explanations)
- Reducing spiritual, psychological, and ideological bypass
- Supporting coherent movement between experiential layers under real-world constraint
- Completing integrative work historically attempted by metaphysical systems *without importing their ontologies or authority structures*

Each layer described here is **valid within its own domain**, but **limited**. No layer is treated as more “real”, “advanced”, or authoritative than the others.

---

## What This Repository Is Not

This is **not**:

- a spiritual or metaphysical system  
- a hierarchy of levels, planes, or stages  
- a self-help or wellness guide  
- a therapeutic protocol  
- a belief framework or doctrine  
- a claim about ultimate reality  

Experiences often described as mystical, transcendent, or symbolic are included **as experiences**, not as explanations or sources of authority.

## Coherence and Layering

Throughout this repository, *coherence* refers to the capacity to remain oriented to reality, responsibility, and constraint while navigating different layers of experience — especially under stress, uncertainty, or contradiction.

Coherence is **not** defined as emotional calm, internal pleasantness, or the maintenance of a preferred state. It is defined by functional integrity under load.

(An explicit definition of coherence is provided in the Human–AI Coherence Corpus.)

## How to Read This Repository

- The layers described here are **not ranks** and do not imply progression.
- Health is understood as *appropriate movement between layers*, not residence in any one of them.
- Many forms of confusion, distress, and ideological capture arise from absolutising a single layer or importing its rules into another.

This repository is best read slowly, as an orientation map rather than a linear argument.

Its purpose is to clarify distinctions, not to close questions.
