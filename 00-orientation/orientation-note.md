# Orientation Note

This repository maps distinct layers of human experience that are often confused, collapsed, or treated as interchangeable. Its purpose is orientation: helping readers recognise *what kind of experience they are having*, what that domain can and cannot do, and where common errors arise when layers are misapplied.

The layers described here are **descriptive**, not prescriptive. They are not stages of development, levels of attainment, or ranks of value. No layer is treated as more real, more advanced, or more authoritative than another.

This repository does not propose a theory of reality. It proposes a way of avoiding category errors when navigating lived experience.

## On Scope and Restraint

Human experience spans multiple domains: bodily, emotional, cognitive, relational, ethical, existential, and symbolic. Confusion arises when the rules, language, or authority of one domain are imported into another without awareness.

This repository deliberately avoids:
- metaphysical claims about the nature of reality
- spiritual or psychological hierarchies
- instructional or therapeutic guidance
- moralisation of particular experiences or states

Experiences commonly described as mystical, transcendent, or symbolic are included **as experiences**, not as explanations or sources of authority.

## Coherence and Layering

Throughout this repository, coherence refers to the capacity to remain oriented to reality, responsibility, and constraint while moving between different layers of experience — especially under stress, uncertainty, conflict, or contradiction.

Coherence is not defined as emotional calm, internal pleasantness, or the maintenance of a preferred state. It is defined by functional integrity under load.

Health, in this context, is not residence in any single layer, but the ability to move between layers appropriately without collapse, absolutism, or bypass.

## Common Sources of Confusion

Many personal, social, and ideological failures arise from:
- treating emotional states as truth
- treating symbolic experience as explanation
- treating moral intuition as certainty
- treating cognitive models as reality
- treating transcendence as superiority

This repository exists to make such confusions visible without ridicule or reduction.

## How to Use This Repository

- Read non-linearly.
- Treat layers as lenses, not identities.
- Notice when a problem belongs to a different layer than the one being applied.
- Resist the urge to turn this into a system of self-improvement or spiritual ascent.

The value of this repository lies in **clarification**, not reassurance.

## Relationship to the Corpus

This repository is part of the broader **Human–AI Coherence Corpus (HACC)**. It is intended to support coherence by clarifying experiential domains, not by offering practices, beliefs, or conclusions.

Other repositories in the corpus explore dynamics, models, and applications that build on this orienting distinction.
