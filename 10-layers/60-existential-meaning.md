# Existential / Meaning Layer

## Description
This layer concerns questions of meaning, identity, finitude, purpose, freedom, and responsibility for one’s life as a whole. It includes confrontation with mortality, irreversibility, choice, and the fact that no external system can fully justify existence on one’s behalf.

Experience at this layer is reflective and burdened. It does not resolve into certainty, comfort, or final answers.

## What This Layer Handles Well
- Grappling with questions of purpose and significance  
- Integrating life as a whole rather than as isolated moments  
- Acknowledging finitude, loss, and irreversibility  
- Clarifying what matters when no rule or authority suffices  
- Holding responsibility without guarantee of meaning  

This layer is where meaning is carried, not discovered as fact.

## What This Layer Cannot Do Alone
- Provide objective answers to existential questions  
- Eliminate uncertainty, anxiety, or ambiguity  
- Justify action without reference to consequence or ethics  
- Replace lived responsibility with insight or realisation  

Existential reflection does not dissolve obligation.

## Common Confusions
- Treating existential insight as resolution  
- Confusing acceptance with transcendence  
- Using meaning narratives to bypass moral responsibility  
- Collapsing existential tension into belief or identity  

Meaning does not remove difficulty; it contextualises it.

## Failure Modes When Absolutised
When this layer is treated as primary or sufficient, it can lead to:
- Nihilism disguised as sophistication  
- Grand narratives used to excuse harm or withdrawal  
- Inflation of personal meaning into moral authority  
- Detachment from practical responsibility or relational reality  

The existential layer deepens human life, but does not stand above consequence or constraint.
