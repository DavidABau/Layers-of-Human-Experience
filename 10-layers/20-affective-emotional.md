# Affective / Emotional Layer

## Description
This layer concerns felt experience: emotions, moods, affective reactions, and embodied emotional signals. It includes subjective states such as fear, anger, joy, grief, desire, and attachment, as well as more diffuse emotional atmospheres.

Experience at this layer is immediate and subjective. It conveys salience and significance, not truth or explanation.

## What This Layer Handles Well
- Signalling personal relevance and value  
- Motivating attention and action  
- Emotional attunement in relationships  
- Rapid appraisal of perceived threat or safety  
- Providing experiential data about internal and relational states  

Emotions function as indicators, not conclusions.

## What This Layer Cannot Do Alone
- Determine factual accuracy or truth  
- Resolve ethical or moral questions  
- Generate reliable explanations of complex situations  
- Justify actions without reference to consequence or context  

Emotional intensity does not confer authority.

## Common Confusions
- Treating emotions as facts or evidence  
- Equating sincerity with correctness  
- Confusing feeling heard with being right  
- Assuming emotional regulation resolves underlying issues  

Emotions require interpretation and contextualisation.

## Failure Modes When Absolutised
When this layer is treated as primary or sufficient, it can lead to:
- Emotional absolutism (“I feel it, therefore it is”)  
- Reactivity framed as authenticity  
- Moralisation of emotional states  
- Bypass of responsibility, consequence, or ethical reasoning  

The affective layer is essential for human experience, but insufficient on its own for coherent orientation.
