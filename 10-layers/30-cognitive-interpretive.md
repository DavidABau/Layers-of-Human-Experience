# Cognitive / Interpretive Layer

## Description
This layer concerns thought, interpretation, reasoning, narrative, and model-building. It includes beliefs, explanations, conceptual frameworks, memories as interpreted stories, and the mental maps used to make sense of experience.

Experience at this layer is representational. It does not directly encounter reality, but constructs interpretations *about* it.

## What This Layer Handles Well
- Pattern recognition and abstraction  
- Explanation and sense-making  
- Planning, prediction, and problem-solving  
- Integrating information across time and contexts  
- Communicating meaning through language and symbols  

This layer enables reflection, learning, and intentional action.

## What This Layer Cannot Do Alone
- Determine moral responsibility or ethical obligation  
- Resolve emotional or relational dynamics by reasoning alone  
- Guarantee truth or accuracy without external constraint  
- Replace lived experience with explanation  

Models are tools, not reality.

## Common Confusions
- Mistaking explanations for truth  
- Treating internally consistent models as correct  
- Using cleverness to bypass responsibility or uncertainty  
- Confusing understanding with resolution  

Cognitive clarity does not equal coherence.

## Failure Modes When Absolutised
When this layer is treated as primary or sufficient, it can lead to:
- Rationalisation and motivated reasoning  
- Ideological capture or rigid belief systems  
- Detachment from embodied, emotional, or relational reality  
- Overconfidence in models that exceed their domain  

The cognitive layer is powerful, but always partial.
