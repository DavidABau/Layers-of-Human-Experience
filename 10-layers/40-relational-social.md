# Relational / Social Layer

## Description
This layer concerns interaction between people: relationships, roles, norms, power dynamics, communication, institutions, and shared meaning. It includes family systems, cultural expectations, group identities, and the implicit rules governing social life.

Experience at this layer is intersubjective. It is shaped by negotiation, constraint, and asymmetry rather than individual intention alone.

## What This Layer Handles Well
- Coordination and cooperation between individuals  
- Transmission of norms, values, and shared meanings  
- Establishment of roles, boundaries, and expectations  
- Distribution of power, responsibility, and authority  
- Collective problem-solving and social organisation  

This layer enables stable social functioning and shared reality.

## What This Layer Cannot Do Alone
- Determine personal truth or individual integrity  
- Resolve moral responsibility by consensus alone  
- Eliminate power asymmetries through goodwill  
- Substitute social harmony for ethical clarity  

Agreement does not guarantee correctness.

## Common Confusions
- Equating social approval with moral validity  
- Treating norms as universal truths  
- Confusing relational comfort with coherence  
- Assuming good intentions neutralise power dynamics  

Social systems constrain behaviour whether acknowledged or not.

## Failure Modes When Absolutised
When this layer is treated as primary or sufficient, it can lead to:
- Conformity enforced as virtue  
- Moral signalling replacing responsibility  
- Suppression of dissent framed as harmony  
- Justification of harm through group norms or loyalty  

The relational layer structures human life, but does not absolve individuals of responsibility.
