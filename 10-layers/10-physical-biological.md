# Physical / Biological Layer

## Description
This layer concerns the body as a living system: physiology, neurobiology, metabolism, sensory input, fatigue, illness, injury, and physical regulation. It includes the nervous system, hormonal responses, and basic survival functions.

Experience at this layer is immediate and non-symbolic. It is governed by biological constraint, not meaning or intention.

## What This Layer Handles Well
- Survival and basic functioning  
- Arousal, rest, and recovery  
- Stress responses and physical regulation  
- Sensory perception and bodily feedback  
- Limits imposed by health, age, injury, and environment  

This layer provides essential data about capacity and load.

## What This Layer Cannot Do Alone
- Generate meaning or values  
- Resolve relational or moral conflicts  
- Explain symbolic, emotional, or existential experience  
- Determine what *ought* to be done  

Biological states influence behaviour, but they do not by themselves explain purpose, truth, or responsibility.

## Common Confusions
- Treating biological states as explanations for all behaviour  
- Assuming regulation equals resolution  
- Reducing complex human experience to physiology alone  
- Treating bodily comfort as a proxy for coherence  

## Failure Modes When Absolutised
When this layer is treated as primary or sufficient, it can lead to:
- Reductionism (explaining meaning, ethics, or identity purely in biological terms)  
- Over-medicalisation of relational or existential problems  
- Avoidance of responsibility framed as “it’s just biology”  
- Confusing physical regulation with alignment or integrity  

The physical layer is foundational, but not explanatory of the whole.
