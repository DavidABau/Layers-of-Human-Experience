# Symbolic / Transpersonal Layer

## Description
This layer concerns symbolic, imaginal, and transpersonal experiences that exceed ordinary personal identity. It includes experiences of unity, dissolution, transcendence, archetypal imagery, mythic meaning, and altered states in which the sense of self or separation is diminished or transformed.

Experience at this layer is often vivid, compelling, and difficult to articulate. It is mediated through symbol, metaphor, and narrative rather than direct explanation.

## What This Layer Handles Well
- Expressing experiences that exceed ordinary language  
- Providing symbolic integration of intense or liminal states  
- Evoking humility, awe, and a sense of larger context  
- Offering meaning-rich imagery for inner experience  
- Supporting psychological and existential integration when held appropriately  

This layer can expand perspective, but does not replace other domains.

## What This Layer Cannot Do Alone
- Explain reality, causality, or ontology  
- Determine moral truth or ethical obligation  
- Override physical, relational, or ethical constraints  
- Confer authority, insight, or superiority  

Symbolic experience is not explanation.

## Common Confusions
- Treating symbolic experience as literal truth  
- Confusing felt unity with moral or epistemic authority  
- Interpreting dissolution as resolution  
- Importing symbolic narratives as guides for action  

Intensity does not equal validity.

## Failure Modes When Absolutised
When this layer is treated as primary or sufficient, it can lead to:
- Metaphysical inflation and certainty without constraint  
- Spiritual bypass of responsibility, conflict, or harm  
- Loss of grounding in physical, relational, or ethical reality  
- Authority claims based on experience rather than accountability  

The symbolic layer is meaningful, but it does not stand above consequence, responsibility, or reality.
