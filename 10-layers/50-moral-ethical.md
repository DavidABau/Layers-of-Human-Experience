# Moral / Ethical Layer

## Description
This layer concerns responsibility, obligation, consequence, and judgment about what ought to be done. It includes ethical reasoning, accountability, commitment, and the recognition that actions have effects on others that cannot be wished away or reinterpreted.

Experience at this layer is normative rather than descriptive. It deals with demands placed on action, not with feelings, explanations, or social approval.

## What This Layer Handles Well
- Clarifying responsibility and obligation  
- Weighing consequences and trade-offs  
- Distinguishing justification from excuse  
- Holding individuals and systems accountable  
- Guiding action under conditions of uncertainty  

This layer is where coherence is tested rather than felt.

## What This Layer Cannot Do Alone
- Eliminate ambiguity or moral remainder  
- Guarantee correctness or purity of outcome  
- Replace judgment with rules or formulas  
- Resolve conflict without cost  

Ethical clarity does not remove tragedy or trade-off.

## Common Confusions
- Treating moral certainty as moral truth  
- Confusing compassion with absolution  
- Using intention to negate consequence  
- Collapsing ethics into emotion, consensus, or belief  

Moral claims require justification beyond sincerity.

## Failure Modes When Absolutised
When this layer is treated as primary or sufficient, it can lead to:
- Moralism and rigid rule enforcement  
- Punitive certainty disguised as righteousness  
- Denial of context, constraint, or human limitation  
- Sacrificing people to principles or abstractions  

The moral layer demands judgment, but resists totalisation.
